He graduated from the Staffordshire University \nin the UK and has been working to support organizations focusing on differently abled individuals.\nInclusivity is supposed to be one of the most vital components behind Volunteerism. Therefore, cultivating a culture of inclusivity in the Volunteering Sector is imperative. \nInclusive volunteering motivates volunteers commit for longer periods of time and has \nthe ability to attract a wider pool of potential volunteers and skills.\nThe differently abled community is one such group that has proven to have so much \nuntouched potential and it is important for Sri Lanka to understand it. \nMerely understanding this concern is not enough, they must be accommodated \nwithin the field of volunteerism in order to utilize their maximum potential.\nVolunteerism has turned out to be a universal term. One of the most important \nrecommendations that can be proposed to improve inclusivity in volunteerism is \nthe development of an education system which has the ability to support and accommodate \nall differently abled people in the community.\n\n## Why is it important for these vividly skilled individuals to volunteer?\n\nThe general sympathetic perception towards the differently abled community, although out of bona fide intent, \nhas been one of the main factors that has been hindering their advancement within the society. \nThey can be very productive in their own fields of expertise and this is the best platform for them to demonstrate \ntheir worth to the world of work. They also deserve to gain the psychological satisfaction out of volunteering and \nthey also deserve the opportunity to understand the World of Work.\n\nHowever, it is the responsibility of the overall society to accommodate them as volunteers.\n\n### What must be done to ensure an effective level of participation of marginalized and vulnerable groups?\n\n## Accessibility\n\nWhen mobilizing differently abled volunteers there must be a set of reliable mechanisms in place to provide \nthem access to relevant locations during their volunteer assignments. The government has the ability to create \nrules and regulations enabling volunteer recruiting institutions to compulsorily put in place the relevant equipment \nand facilities before they recruit new volunteers. Disability friendly volunteering working arrangements must be identified \nand disability friendly working environments should be encouraged.\n\n## Sensitization\n\nIt is also important to make sure that the volunteers have a welcoming environment during their tenure of work. \nThe recruiters and their co-workers can be trained to work with them under the following method. \nThe government can make sure that the people who are working with differently abled volunteers have undergone special \ntraining and are sensitive to their needs and are fully capable of working with them. Carrying out workshops for volunteers \nin collaboration with organizations specializing on differently abled people can support this cause.\n\n## Mandatory Quotas\n\nDifferently abled volunteers are a disadvantaged group and there are certain instances where they are ill-treated because of this reason. \nUnfortunately, this can also be seen in the Volunteering Sector too. To overcome this prejudice, the government can implement mandatory \nquotas on recruiters to recruit a set percentage of differently abled volunteers compulsorily.\n\n## Volunteer Competency Assessments\n\nThe Volunteer Secretariat can monitor the competency of these individuals to make sure that the volunteer recruiters are getting \nthe best they can obtain. Through assessing their competencies, the secretariat can also get a proper understanding of the skills, \nstrong and week points of the volunteers.\n\n## Creating Manuals for the Employers to Deal with the Disabled\n\nThe government can get together with the experts in the relevant field and create guiding manuals or provide guidelines to \ninstitutions that recruit volunteers. These manuals can also be distributed among volunteers in order to make them sensitive towards these issues.\n\n## Online Volunteering\n\nThe promotion of online volunteerism is considered to be one of the most effective ways of improving inclusivity. \nMost of the members of the differently abled community have difficulties in moving from one place to another \nfrequently and this has been, for the longest time, been one of the biggest demotivators for many volunteers. \nTo overcome this barrier, it is possible for us to use Online Platforms to get individuals to volunteer.\n\n## Encouraging Institutions that Support Disabled Volunteers\n\nNot just the volunteers, the government can also encourage institutions that recruit differently abled volunteers. \nThis can be done using online platforms such as YouTube Channels by creating videos appreciating the institutions \nthat are involved in recruiting differently abled volunteers. Other means of recognition can also be used such Awards Ceremonies. \nThe government can also provide other forms supportive services to these institutions. Volunteer recruiters must be encouraged to \nissue certificates confirming the volunteer contributions of differently abled volunteers which will be proof to show that they are fit for the world of work.\n\nIn conclusion, the government should be more aware of these widely talented individuals and their contributions to volunteerism and most importantly the \nstate should actively encourage inclusivity within the society. People should find different ways of working together as a community. \nRecognition and appreciation of these people will fuel their passion in volunteerism and this workforce will one day become the most significant stakeholders in a better inclusive future.\n\nMost importantly we must understand that what they want is not our sympathy but for us to understand their situation and be empathetic towards them so that they can live like the rest \nof us in this society and be a lot more productive.\n`\n}, {\n  name: 'article02',\n  title: 'Unlocking the potential of youth with disabilities by strengthening labour market participation',\n  content: `Persons with Disabilities are an integral component of the population. \nThe 2011 census carried out by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS)\nrecords indicate that 8.7% of the total population are Persons with Disabilities. \nHowever, there were serious concerns regarding the definition and criteria for identifying a Person with Disability during the census.\nUnder Section 18 of the Protection of Persons with Disabilities Act no. 28 of 1996, \na disabled person is defined as ‘anyone, as a result of any deficiency in their \nphysical or mental capabilities, whether congenital or not, is unable by themselves to ensure, \nwholly or partly, the necessities of life.\n\nEven though disability is an evolving concept, the legislative definition of \nPersons with Disabilities emphasises their dependency and highlighting \ninsensitivity towards disability. Thus, policy pronouncements notwithstanding, \npersons with intellectual disabilities and those with severe disabilities are frequently \ndenied their most fundamental human rights and participation in society.\n\nPersons with Disabilities have been consistently marginalised in Sri Lankaand are often \ndenied opportunities to participate effectively in the public realm. This denial stems from \nthe idyllic view of the able-bodied common man which has led to the State allocating its resources \nand revamping the existing structure. However, viewing from the lens of an average disabled person, \nthis necessarily amounts to the denial of fundamental rights of Persons with Disabilities; alluding \nto archaic cultures and attitudes that perceive disability as a penance for past sins and a burden.\n\nThis thought has influenced dominant charity-based discourses on matters relating to Persons with Disabilities. \nThe attitudinal barriers play a major role in stagnation of policies and regulations. They further frustrate the accessibility, \ninclusivity and participation of Persons with Disabilities in different spheres such as employment.\n\nDespite Sri Lanka recognising that every person has a right to earn a living, this also includes persons with difficulties. \nSeveral policies and legislation to support persons with disabilities have been enacted or adapted in the last 25 years. \nThese include:Rehabilitation of the Visually Handicapped Trust Fund, Act No.9 of 1992, Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, \nNo.28 of 1996; and the National Policy on Disability for Sri Lanka of 2003.\n\nAdditionally, the supreme source of the law Sri Lankan Constitution Under Article 12 \nthat deals with fundamental rights, in the anti-discrimination Clauses (2) and (3), \npeople with disabilities are not mentioned as a separate group. \nThey are recognised as being within clause (1), which states that; \n“All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal \nprotection of the Law In addition, Clause (4) allows for “special provision \nbeing made by law, subordinate legislation or executive action, \nfor the advancement of women, children or disabled persons.”\n\nThe Public Administration Circular No.27/88 of August 18, 1988 instructs all ministries, \ndepartments and corporations to allocate 3% of job opportunities to Persons with Disabilities, \nhowever, there is neither evidence of this implementation for evaluation nor are their lessons learnt. \nConsequently, Persons with Disabilities have perceived that this circular was not implemented as planned with expected progress.\n\nTo date, some of the public services do not adhere to this allocation in an equal manner as there are no \nParliamentary Acts to enforce this provision with more legal status. One observation is that there is a \nlack of awareness and understanding of Persons with Disabilities on “how and where” to report such incidents.\n\nEmployment in the private sector is limited and available only to a small percentage of individuals with disabilities. \nThis is a consequence of negative attitudes of employers, especially due to the lack of sensitivity and practical understanding, \nof the skills and abilities of people who are disabled, and needs and rights to mainstream persons with disabilities into employment.\n\nEntrepreneurs with disabilities are also prone to exploitation and possible failure because of the poor standard of education received. \nSuch people may be left with no option but to work for themselves. There are also serious concerns regarding vocational training systems \nfor people with disabilities due to a mismatch between job demands and skills development. Furthermore, insufficient sign language \ninstructors and the unavailability of training in Braille is yet another barrier to enter the workforce.\n\nFurthermore, women with disabilities face higher difficulties in obtaining a job than their male counterparts. \nThis situation can be addressed by fully implementing the International Labour Organization’s \nVocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Disabled Persons) Convention No. 159 (1955).\n\nThe primary goal of ILO is to promote equal opportunities for women and men, \nincluding those with disabilities, to obtain decent work. The ILO defines \ndecent work as productive work on conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. \nPeople with disabilities, irrespective of where they live, want and need the same things as everyone else: \na home, good health, and a full life, including the chance for decent work and to enjoy the resulting financial, social and psychological benefits.\n\nIf the policymakers and enactors really think about social integration and leaving no one behind, then, sustainable development comes in to play to do so. \nWhere disabled youth have the right to be independent and lead a life with dignity and self-respect. \nTo leave no on behind the country should be economically self-sufficient. To reach self-sufficiency in the economy, \nemployment rates need to be high.\n\nThere must be an enabled environment for disabled talents to work. For this to come to light, existing policies and administrative \ncirculars should be implemented to the fullest capacity. As a disabled youth myself, the community that I belong to, dislikes being \ndependent on others. Hence, as a country that considers employment as a right for all, there needs to be more inclusive systems to ensure we leave no one behind.\n\nThe writer is an independent disabled rights advocate.

One in five people are aged between 15 and 24. Yet, young people are often not in the places where \n    decisions are made, being at risk of exclusion and inequality. They face obstacles to political participation, are more vulnerable to \n    poverty than the average population, and their number in conflict areas has dramatically increased in past years.At the same time, \n    it has been estimated that young people are more likely than older adults to become entrepreneurs, have higher literacy rates and are more \n    connected through technology than ever before. These qualities make the youngsters a very powerful tool to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nTo give voice to their ideas, the 2019 UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Youth Forum gathered more than \n1,000 young leaders from around the world, to share how they would achieve the Global Goals. The forum is the \nworld’s largest youth forum and the only official intergovernmental meeting that brings youth representatives \ntogether with government ministers and officials.\n\nAt the centre of this year’s discussion was the role of young people in building a future without conflict and inequalities. It is crucial that they are able to better connect, and participate fully to sustain peace and bridge the gaps in the areas of gender, poverty, education, disability and political inclusion.\n\n## Creating Inclusive Spaces\n\n![article03_image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*it7yQZRwfu4Ur4ucbNyeMA.jpeg)\n\nKasunjith Satanarchchi is the Youth Lead for UNDP in Sri Lanka. He is the first disabled person to have been recruited by UNDP in Asia. Together with his team, he is working to improve the workspaces of UNDP Sri Lanka, and other UN agencies, to include more disabled people. “UNDP has understood the value of being inclusive in the workforce since it has made them think ‘outside the box’ and view things from a different perspective,” he says.\n\nInitiatives include improving accessibility, supplying documents in other formats, such as Braille, and training colleagues. It’s crucial that team members understand the dynamics of disability and that they learn how to work with young people of different abilities, making them feel comfortable and unlocking their potential.\n\n“We need to mainstream disability into the existing workforce fully of UNDP, which cannot be done without the participation of persons with disabilities. We believe that nothing about us without us,” he says.\n\n###### By Daniela Peris, Spanish Social Media and Web Editor Intern at UNDP New York.`\n}, {\n  name: 'article04',\n  title: 'ECOSOC Youth Forum: Volunteerism key to fostering inclusion of youth and people with disabilities in sustainable development',\n  date: '15 April 2019, New York, United States',\n  content: `Kasunjith Satanarachchi is the first person with disability from Asia and the Pacific region to participate during the 8th Annual Youth Forum of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in New York.

It is very important that the disabled community is not left behind in the recognition of Sustainable Development Goals. --Kasunjith Satanarachchi, during the 2019 ECOSOC Youth Forum\n    \nThe theme for this year’s Forum was \"Youth: Empowered, Included and Equal. It provided a great platform for young leaders from around the world to engage in dialogue among themselves and with Member States on advancing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. UNV and partners are working together to ensure inclusion for young professionals with disabilities.\n    \nTo this end, Kasunjith was approached by the organizers of the Forum to be the moderator at the SDG Media Zone panel discussion Act Now for a Sustainable Future. The Media Zone served as a dynamic platform to amplify youth voices and spur action on the 2030 Agenda.\n    \n##### \"This was the first time I ever moderated a session. It was a very exciting opportunity, especially because I had eminent panellist who really inspired me to act now or never,\" Kasunjith shares.\n    \nUNV Deputy Executive Coordinator Toily Kurbanov participated in a discussion hosted by H.E. Inga Rhonda King, President of ECOSOC, explaining UNV’s engagement with young people as volunteers in the UN system. He expressed the need for governments to work on enabling environments for volunteering through different measures, as well as encouraging everyone to be involved in online Plan of Action consultations on reimagining youth volunteering for the 2030 Agenda.\n    \nKasunjith is currently a UN Youth Volunteer serving as UNDP Youth Lead for Sri Lanka Country Office. His area of work is mainly focused on mapping the disability sector, accessibility of the UN Compound in Colombo and working with the Governance and Peacebuilding portfolio of UNDP. He was the first person to be recruited under the UNDP/UNV talent programme for young professional with disabilities.  He has published an article on his experience: The sky is the limit: UN Volunteers with disabilities create more inclusive workplaces.`\n}, {\n  name: 'article05',\n  title: 'Sky is the limit: Determined to prove everyone wrong',\n  date: 'Wednesday, 5 December 2018',\n  content: `“From my younger days, I had three dreams. One of it was to have the opportunity to work as a part of the UN System. Through the Youth Leads program, I have now been able to achieve this.” 28 year old Kasunjith Satanaarachchi, sits back and reminisces of the long journey it has been to get to this point. Kasunjith is an individual living with Cerebral Palsy and while majority of persons with disabilities living in Sri Lanka choose not to pursue their studies, he was determined to prove everyone wrong\n    \nHailing from a town in the Southern Province of Sri Lanka, he attended Kalutara Maha Vidyalaya where he completed his studies from Grade 1 to Grade 11 after passing his GCE Ordinary Level exams. The 11 years in school were not the easiest. Kasunjith had to go through constant bullying and rude comments from his teachers. One experience that he vividly remembers, was an instance when the sectional head of the school spoke to his parents. He had asked them why they were wasting their time and money trying to educate their child, who should be just left at home.\n    \nMajority of Sri Lankan schools are not equipped and lack training to teach children with disabilities. But still he persisted.\n    \nHe then enrolled himself to the Gurulugomi Maha Vidyalaya, an advanced level school supported by the ICRC. The administration was more welcoming of him, provided special washroom facilities and it is here that he completed his studies by passing the GCE Advanced Level examination with 1A and 2Bs as results. With his excellent results, he had the opportunity of entering a state university. However, due to the stringent regulations for applicants with disabilities, he was given limited subject streams to choose from. Kasunjith showed a great interest to pursue Law after having studied Logic and Political Science in school, so it was a disappointing realisation with the limited allocations for students like him. He decided to enrol himself in a private university which offered the Staffordshire University degree. It was here that he felt like he was finally accepted. \n    \n#### Greater things to come \n    \nAfter three years of hard work, he obtained an LLB with a 2nd class in law. This was the start of greater things to come. Kasunjith went on to win Mock trial mooting competitions and was also a part of the Youth Parliament of Sri Lanka from 2016-2017, where he was the Deputy Minister of International Affairs and the Representative for persons living with disabilities. \n    \nHe then worked as the youth focal point for a Disability Rights Organization for three years and also has experience working as a research intern at a leading law firm. His articles in Sinhala and English have also been featured in national newspapers such as Silumina and Daily FT. It was during this period that he was fortunate to receive the opportunity to visit the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. \n    \n#### Young Talent Programme\n    \nUnder the ‘Talent Programme for Young Professionals with Disabilities’, globally, the United Nations Development Programme and United Nations Volunteers have designed this talent programme to enhance the employability and career prospects of young professionals with disabilities through work experience with offices and build a talent pipeline of highly qualified professionals with disabilities who can contribute to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals at national and global levels.\n    \nAs a part of this programme, UNDP’s Youth Lead’s programme saw the inclusion of a young individual with disabilities this year. When Kasunjith saw the advertisement for the programme, he completely dismissed the possibility of him being able to qualify for the position. It was his friend who prompted him to apply for the vacancy. “I couldn’t believe it when I got the call-back for an interview.” From then on, everything else just fell into place and the third batch Youth Leads came on board in August 2018.\n    \n#### UNDP Youth Leads\n\n![article05_image](http://static.ft.lk/assets/uploads/image_18dea5e65e.jpg) \n                        \n| *UNDP Youth Leads 2018*|\n    \nThe UNDP Youth Leads programme was first introduced in 2015, as another step forward in opening UNDP up to young people of the country. A cohort of four dynamic young people would be chosen to work within the core areas of UNDP’s portfolio for 50% of their time – such as the governance, environment, and support teams – while the other half of their time would be spent working together as a team furthering the innovation portfolio of UNDP. \n    \nKasunjith as a part of his assignment has worked on mapping the disability sector, the Comprehensive Youth Development Programme, accessibility of the UN Compound in Colombo and is working closely with colleagues working with the Governance and Peacebuilding portfolio of UNDP. \n    \nHe is proud to be the first person with disabilities in Asia to be working with UNDP as a part of this programme.

He graduated from the Staffordshire University \nin the UK and has been working to support organizations focusing on differently abled individuals.\nInclusivity is supposed to be one of the most vital components behind Volunteerism. Therefore, cultivating a culture of inclusivity in the Volunteering Sector is imperative. \nInclusive volunteering motivates volunteers commit for longer periods of time and has \nthe ability to attract a wider pool of potential volunteers and skills.\nThe differently abled community is one such group that has proven to have so much \nuntouched potential and it is important for Sri Lanka to understand it. \nMerely understanding this concern is not enough, they must be accommodated \nwithin the field of volunteerism in order to utilize their maximum potential.\nVolunteerism has turned out to be a universal term. One of the most important \nrecommendations that can be proposed to improve inclusivity in volunteerism is \nthe development of an education system which has the ability to support and accommodate \nall differently abled people in the community.\n\n## Why is it important for these vividly skilled individuals to volunteer?\n\nThe general sympathetic perception towards the differently abled community, although out of bona fide intent, \nhas been one of the main factors that has been hindering their advancement within the society. \nThey can be very productive in their own fields of expertise and this is the best platform for them to demonstrate \ntheir worth to the world of work. They also deserve to gain the psychological satisfaction out of volunteering and \nthey also deserve the opportunity to understand the World of Work.\n\nHowever, it is the responsibility of the overall society to accommodate them as volunteers.\n\n### What must be done to ensure an effective level of participation of marginalized and vulnerable groups?\n\n## Accessibility\n\nWhen mobilizing differently abled volunteers there must be a set of reliable mechanisms in place to provide \nthem access to relevant locations during their volunteer assignments. The government has the ability to create \nrules and regulations enabling volunteer recruiting institutions to compulsorily put in place the relevant equipment \nand facilities before they recruit new volunteers. Disability friendly volunteering working arrangements must be identified \nand disability friendly working environments should be encouraged.\n\n## Sensitization\n\nIt is also important to make sure that the volunteers have a welcoming environment during their tenure of work. \nThe recruiters and their co-workers can be trained to work with them under the following method. \nThe government can make sure that the people who are working with differently abled volunteers have undergone special \ntraining and are sensitive to their needs and are fully capable of working with them. Carrying out workshops for volunteers \nin collaboration with organizations specializing on differently abled people can support this cause.\n\n## Mandatory Quotas\n\nDifferently abled volunteers are a disadvantaged group and there are certain instances where they are ill-treated because of this reason. \nUnfortunately, this can also be seen in the Volunteering Sector too. To overcome this prejudice, the government can implement mandatory \nquotas on recruiters to recruit a set percentage of differently abled volunteers compulsorily.\n\n## Volunteer Competency Assessments\n\nThe Volunteer Secretariat can monitor the competency of these individuals to make sure that the volunteer recruiters are getting \nthe best they can obtain. Through assessing their competencies, the secretariat can also get a proper understanding of the skills, \nstrong and week points of the volunteers.\n\n## Creating Manuals for the Employers to Deal with the Disabled\n\nThe government can get together with the experts in the relevant field and create guiding manuals or provide guidelines to \ninstitutions that recruit volunteers. These manuals can also be distributed among volunteers in order to make them sensitive towards these issues.\n\n## Online Volunteering\n\nThe promotion of online volunteerism is considered to be one of the most effective ways of improving inclusivity. \nMost of the members of the differently abled community have difficulties in moving from one place to another \nfrequently and this has been, for the longest time, been one of the biggest demotivators for many volunteers. \nTo overcome this barrier, it is possible for us to use Online Platforms to get individuals to volunteer.\n\n## Encouraging Institutions that Support Disabled Volunteers\n\nNot just the volunteers, the government can also encourage institutions that recruit differently abled volunteers. \nThis can be done using online platforms such as YouTube Channels by creating videos appreciating the institutions \nthat are involved in recruiting differently abled volunteers. Other means of recognition can also be used such Awards Ceremonies. \nThe government can also provide other forms supportive services to these institutions. Volunteer recruiters must be encouraged to \nissue certificates confirming the volunteer contributions of differently abled volunteers which will be proof to show that they are fit for the world of work.\n\nIn conclusion, the government should be more aware of these widely talented individuals and their contributions to volunteerism and most importantly the \nstate should actively encourage inclusivity within the society. People should find different ways of working together as a community. \nRecognition and appreciation of these people will fuel their passion in volunteerism and this workforce will one day become the most significant stakeholders in a better inclusive future.\n\nMost importantly we must understand that what they want is not our sympathy but for us to understand their situation and be empathetic towards them so that they can live like the rest \nof us in this society and be a lot more productive.\n`\n    },\n    {\n        name: 'article02',\n        title: 'Unlocking the potential of youth with disabilities by strengthening labour market participation',\n        content: `Persons with Disabilities are an integral component of the population. \nThe 2011 census carried out by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS)\nrecords indicate that 8.7% of the total population are Persons with Disabilities. \nHowever, there were serious concerns regarding the definition and criteria for identifying a Person with Disability during the census.\nUnder Section 18 of the Protection of Persons with Disabilities Act no. 28 of 1996, \na disabled person is defined as ‘anyone, as a result of any deficiency in their \nphysical or mental capabilities, whether congenital or not, is unable by themselves to ensure, \nwholly or partly, the necessities of life.\n\nEven though disability is an evolving concept, the legislative definition of \nPersons with Disabilities emphasises their dependency and highlighting \ninsensitivity towards disability. Thus, policy pronouncements notwithstanding, \npersons with intellectual disabilities and those with severe disabilities are frequently \ndenied their most fundamental human rights and participation in society.\n\nPersons with Disabilities have been consistently marginalised in Sri Lankaand are often \ndenied opportunities to participate effectively in the public realm. This denial stems from \nthe idyllic view of the able-bodied common man which has led to the State allocating its resources \nand revamping the existing structure. However, viewing from the lens of an average disabled person, \nthis necessarily amounts to the denial of fundamental rights of Persons with Disabilities; alluding \nto archaic cultures and attitudes that perceive disability as a penance for past sins and a burden.\n\nThis thought has influenced dominant charity-based discourses on matters relating to Persons with Disabilities. \nThe attitudinal barriers play a major role in stagnation of policies and regulations. They further frustrate the accessibility, \ninclusivity and participation of Persons with Disabilities in different spheres such as employment.\n\nDespite Sri Lanka recognising that every person has a right to earn a living, this also includes persons with difficulties. \nSeveral policies and legislation to support persons with disabilities have been enacted or adapted in the last 25 years. \nThese include:Rehabilitation of the Visually Handicapped Trust Fund, Act No.9 of 1992, Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, \nNo.28 of 1996; and the National Policy on Disability for Sri Lanka of 2003.\n\nAdditionally, the supreme source of the law Sri Lankan Constitution Under Article 12 \nthat deals with fundamental rights, in the anti-discrimination Clauses (2) and (3), \npeople with disabilities are not mentioned as a separate group. \nThey are recognised as being within clause (1), which states that; \n“All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal \nprotection of the Law In addition, Clause (4) allows for “special provision \nbeing made by law, subordinate legislation or executive action, \nfor the advancement of women, children or disabled persons.”\n\nThe Public Administration Circular No.27/88 of August 18, 1988 instructs all ministries, \ndepartments and corporations to allocate 3% of job opportunities to Persons with Disabilities, \nhowever, there is neither evidence of this implementation for evaluation nor are their lessons learnt. \nConsequently, Persons with Disabilities have perceived that this circular was not implemented as planned with expected progress.\n\nTo date, some of the public services do not adhere to this allocation in an equal manner as there are no \nParliamentary Acts to enforce this provision with more legal status. One observation is that there is a \nlack of awareness and understanding of Persons with Disabilities on “how and where” to report such incidents.\n\nEmployment in the private sector is limited and available only to a small percentage of individuals with disabilities. \nThis is a consequence of negative attitudes of employers, especially due to the lack of sensitivity and practical understanding, \nof the skills and abilities of people who are disabled, and needs and rights to mainstream persons with disabilities into employment.\n\nEntrepreneurs with disabilities are also prone to exploitation and possible failure because of the poor standard of education received. \nSuch people may be left with no option but to work for themselves. There are also serious concerns regarding vocational training systems \nfor people with disabilities due to a mismatch between job demands and skills development. Furthermore, insufficient sign language \ninstructors and the unavailability of training in Braille is yet another barrier to enter the workforce.\n\nFurthermore, women with disabilities face higher difficulties in obtaining a job than their male counterparts. \nThis situation can be addressed by fully implementing the International Labour Organization’s \nVocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Disabled Persons) Convention No. 159 (1955).\n\nThe primary goal of ILO is to promote equal opportunities for women and men, \nincluding those with disabilities, to obtain decent work. The ILO defines \ndecent work as productive work on conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. \nPeople with disabilities, irrespective of where they live, want and need the same things as everyone else: \na home, good health, and a full life, including the chance for decent work and to enjoy the resulting financial, social and psychological benefits.\n\nIf the policymakers and enactors really think about social integration and leaving no one behind, then, sustainable development comes in to play to do so. \nWhere disabled youth have the right to be independent and lead a life with dignity and self-respect. \nTo leave no on behind the country should be economically self-sufficient. To reach self-sufficiency in the economy, \nemployment rates need to be high.\n\nThere must be an enabled environment for disabled talents to work. For this to come to light, existing policies and administrative \ncirculars should be implemented to the fullest capacity. As a disabled youth myself, the community that I belong to, dislikes being \ndependent on others. Hence, as a country that considers employment as a right for all, there needs to be more inclusive systems to ensure we leave no one behind.\n\nThe writer is an independent disabled rights advocate.

One in five people are aged between 15 and 24. Yet, young people are often not in the places where \n    decisions are made, being at risk of exclusion and inequality. They face obstacles to political participation, are more vulnerable to \n    poverty than the average population, and their number in conflict areas has dramatically increased in past years.At the same time, \n    it has been estimated that young people are more likely than older adults to become entrepreneurs, have higher literacy rates and are more \n    connected through technology than ever before. These qualities make the youngsters a very powerful tool to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nTo give voice to their ideas, the 2019 UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Youth Forum gathered more than \n1,000 young leaders from around the world, to share how they would achieve the Global Goals. The forum is the \nworld’s largest youth forum and the only official intergovernmental meeting that brings youth representatives \ntogether with government ministers and officials.\n\nAt the centre of this year’s discussion was the role of young people in building a future without conflict and inequalities. It is crucial that they are able to better connect, and participate fully to sustain peace and bridge the gaps in the areas of gender, poverty, education, disability and political inclusion.\n\n## Creating Inclusive Spaces\n\n![article03_image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*it7yQZRwfu4Ur4ucbNyeMA.jpeg)\n\nKasunjith Satanarchchi is the Youth Lead for UNDP in Sri Lanka. He is the first disabled person to have been recruited by UNDP in Asia. Together with his team, he is working to improve the workspaces of UNDP Sri Lanka, and other UN agencies, to include more disabled people. “UNDP has understood the value of being inclusive in the workforce since it has made them think ‘outside the box’ and view things from a different perspective,” he says.\n\nInitiatives include improving accessibility, supplying documents in other formats, such as Braille, and training colleagues. It’s crucial that team members understand the dynamics of disability and that they learn how to work with young people of different abilities, making them feel comfortable and unlocking their potential.\n\n“We need to mainstream disability into the existing workforce fully of UNDP, which cannot be done without the participation of persons with disabilities.

It is very important that the disabled community is not left behind in the recognition of Sustainable Development Goals. --Kasunjith Satanarachchi, during the 2019 ECOSOC Youth Forum\n    \nThe theme for this year’s Forum was \"Youth: Empowered, Included and Equal. It provided a great platform for young leaders from around the world to engage in dialogue among themselves and with Member States on advancing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. UNV and partners are working together to ensure inclusion for young professionals with disabilities.\n    \nTo this end, Kasunjith was approached by the organizers of the Forum to be the moderator at the SDG Media Zone panel discussion Act Now for a Sustainable Future. The Media Zone served as a dynamic platform to amplify youth voices and spur action on the 2030 Agenda.\n    \n##### \"This was the first time I ever moderated a session.

Inga Rhonda King, President of ECOSOC, explaining UNV’s engagement with young people as volunteers in the UN system. He expressed the need for governments to work on enabling environments for volunteering through different measures, as well as encouraging everyone to be involved in online Plan of Action consultations on reimagining youth volunteering for the 2030 Agenda.\n    \nKasunjith is currently a UN Youth Volunteer serving as UNDP Youth Lead for Sri Lanka Country Office. His area of work is mainly focused on mapping the disability sector, accessibility of the UN Compound in Colombo and working with the Governance and Peacebuilding portfolio of UNDP. He was the first person to be recruited under the UNDP/UNV talent programme for young professional with disabilities.  He has published an article on his experience: The sky is the limit: UN Volunteers with disabilities create more inclusive workplaces.`\n    },\n    {\n        name: 'article05',\n        title: 'Sky is the limit: Determined to prove everyone wrong',\n        date: 'Wednesday, 5 December 2018',\n        content: `“From my younger days, I had three dreams. One of it was to have the opportunity to work as a part of the UN System. Through the Youth Leads program, I have now been able to achieve this.” 28 year old Kasunjith Satanaarachchi, sits back and reminisces of the long journey it has been to get to this point. Kasunjith is an individual living with Cerebral Palsy and while majority of persons with disabilities living in Sri Lanka choose not to pursue their studies, he was determined to prove everyone wrong\n    \nHailing from a town in the Southern Province of Sri Lanka, he attended Kalutara Maha Vidyalaya where he completed his studies from Grade 1 to Grade 11 after passing his GCE Ordinary Level exams. The 11 years in school were not the easiest. Kasunjith had to go through constant bullying and rude comments from his teachers. One experience that he vividly remembers, was an instance when the sectional head of the school spoke to his parents. He had asked them why they were wasting their time and money trying to educate their child, who should be just left at home.\n    \nMajority of Sri Lankan schools are not equipped and lack training to teach children with disabilities. But still he persisted.\n    \nHe then enrolled himself to the Gurulugomi Maha Vidyalaya, an advanced level school supported by the ICRC. The administration was more welcoming of him, provided special washroom facilities and it is here that he completed his studies by passing the GCE Advanced Level examination with 1A and 2Bs as results. With his excellent results, he had the opportunity of entering a state university. However, due to the stringent regulations for applicants with disabilities, he was given limited subject streams to choose from. Kasunjith showed a great interest to pursue Law after having studied Logic and Political Science in school, so it was a disappointing realisation with the limited allocations for students like him. He decided to enrol himself in a private university which offered the Staffordshire University degree. It was here that he felt like he was finally accepted. \n    \n#### Greater things to come \n    \nAfter three years of hard work, he obtained an LLB with a 2nd class in law. This was the start of greater things to come. Kasunjith went on to win Mock trial mooting competitions and was also a part of the Youth Parliament of Sri Lanka from 2016-2017, where he was the Deputy Minister of International Affairs and the Representative for persons living with disabilities. \n    \nHe then worked as the youth focal point for a Disability Rights Organization for three years and also has experience working as a research intern at a leading law firm. His articles in Sinhala and English have also been featured in national newspapers such as Silumina and Daily FT. It was during this period that he was fortunate to receive the opportunity to visit the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. \n    \n#### Young Talent Programme\n    \nUnder the ‘Talent Programme for Young Professionals with Disabilities’, globally, the United Nations Development Programme and United Nations Volunteers have designed this talent programme to enhance the employability and career prospects of young professionals with disabilities through work experience with offices and build a talent pipeline of highly qualified professionals with disabilities who can contribute to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals at national and global levels.\n    \nAs a part of this programme, UNDP’s Youth Lead’s programme saw the inclusion of a young individual with disabilities this year. When Kasunjith saw the advertisement for the programme, he completely dismissed the possibility of him being able to qualify for the position. It was his friend who prompted him to apply for the vacancy. “I couldn’t believe it when I got the call-back for an interview.” From then on, everything else just fell into place and the third batch Youth Leads came on board in August 2018.\n    \n#### UNDP Youth Leads\n\n![article05_image](http://static.ft.lk/assets/uploads/image_18dea5e65e.jpg) \n                        \n| *UNDP Youth Leads 2018*|\n    \nThe UNDP Youth Leads programme was first introduced in 2015, as another step forward in opening UNDP up to young people of the country. A cohort of four dynamic young people would be chosen to work within the core areas of UNDP’s portfolio for 50% of their time – such as the governance, environment, and support teams – while the other half of their time would be spent working together as a team furthering the innovation portfolio of UNDP. \n    \nKasunjith as a part of his assignment has worked on mapping the disability sector, the Comprehensive Youth Development Programme, accessibility of the UN Compound in Colombo and is working closely with colleagues working with the Governance and Peacebuilding portfolio of UNDP. \n    \nHe is proud to be the first person with disabilities in Asia to be working with UNDP as a part of this programme. His teammates describe him as a “passionate individual who does not give up”.\n    \n#### Next steps\n\nKasunjith hopes to go on and complete a Masters in Disability Studies and continue to be an advocate for the rights of persons living with disabilities in Sri Lanka.\n    \n##### “I do not expect much from people, but my only wish is to always look for ways in which I can contribute to society.”\n    \n##### “I have achieved two out of three dreams in life.
